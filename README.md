# OptimalRouteAlgorithm

To run the algorithm, run: **node OpOptimalRoute.js** or **npm run start** while in the root directory.

This is my solution for the OptimalRoute algorithm. I have attached the input.csv and once the code has ran, you should be able to see the desired results in output.csv.
